Udemy Tutor - Andre Lamothe

## Part one - Magic Wand

* Circuit Maker has different ICs and its specifications stored in the cloud.
* Circuit maker doesn't have simulations so we should make sure the connections made are checked at each step, using other tools like Proteus.
* Study the presence of these components on digikey, view it's specifications and dimensions and how we could implement it in circuitmaker.
* Make sure we take those components that has 3D models so we can visualize the final PCB layouts.
